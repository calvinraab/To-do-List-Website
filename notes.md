Notes:

- remember to do just 'python' when on windows
- In the installed apps the 'auth' related stuff is very important

superuser username: calvin
Password: calvin

user: joe
Password: joe (maybe)

user: adam
password: thisisadamspassword123!

User: Test
Password: Letstestthispassword!

To figure out:

- Whenever I am creating a user currently it appears to save thier password as their email as well? Not sure why that is. It doesn't appear to be doing that in the video.

Video I left off on: 63
